"""
Canonical protocol definitions and message formats for the VPN tunnel.

Defines the binary wire format used between VPN client and server over the
TLS transport layer.  Both sides share this module through Python's standard
import mechanism; the server and client ``protocol.py`` shims simply re-export
from here.

Wire format (big-endian)::

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  4 bytes  │  1 byte   │       36 bytes        │   N bytes       │
    │  length   │  command  │  session_id (or zeros) │  payload bytes  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

* **length** — total frame size in bytes (including the 4-byte length field itself).
* **command** — single unsigned byte mapped to a ``Commands`` enum member.
* **session_id** — ASCII UUID-4 string, or 36 null bytes when no session is open.
* **payload** — arbitrary bytes whose interpretation depends on the command.

All edge cases (unknown command, malformed length, non-ASCII session_id) raise
subclasses of ``ProtocolError`` so callers can handle them uniformly.

    """A fully structured VPN application-layer message.

    This dataclass is the lingua franca passed between all layers.  Raw bytes
    received from the network are immediately parsed into a ``VPNMessage``
    via ``decode_message``; application code builds ``VPNMessage`` objects and
    serialises them via ``encode_message`` before writing to a socket.

    Attributes:
        command: One of the ``Commands`` enum values (stored as its string value).
        payload: Arbitrary byte payload whose semantics depend on *command*.
            For AUTH, this is a JSON object ``{"username": ..., "password": ...}``.
            For CONNECT, this is ``{"host": ..., "port": ...}``.
            For OK/ERROR, this is a human-readable ASCII reason string.
        session_id: Optional 36-character UUID-4 string that ties the message to
            an authenticated session.  ``None`` when no session exists yet (e.g.
            during the AUTH handshake).

    Example:
        >>> msg = VPNMessage(command=Commands.OK.value, payload=b"Authenticated.", session_id="abc-...")

    The output is a contiguous byte sequence ready to be passed directly to

    on the caller's side because the length is embedded in the frame itself.

    Args:

            ``Commands`` enum value (or its string equivalent).  If
            ``msg.session_id`` is provided it must be exactly 36 ASCII characters
