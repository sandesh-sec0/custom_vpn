"""
Network-level security policy enforcement for the VPN server.

Maintains two independent block lists:

* **Permanent blocklist** (``ip_blocklist``) — IPs added via ``block_ip`` with
  ``duration_seconds=0``.  Persists for the life of the process.  Intended for
  known-hostile addresses that an operator wants to ban indefinitely.
* **Temporal blocklist** (``_temporal_blocks``) — IPs added with a positive
  ``duration_seconds``.  A background daemon thread (``_scheduled_unblock_loop``)
  sweeps expired entries every 10 seconds.

``SecurityPolicy.is_blocked`` is called in the ``VPNServer._accept_loop`` for
every incoming connection *before* TLS wrapping, so hostile traffic is dropped
at the TCP level without incurring any cryptographic cost.
